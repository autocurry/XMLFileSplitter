# XMLFileSplitter

XMLFile Splitter is a simple python based tkinter application. 

What problem does it solve : Think of you have a huge xml file say around 500MB. Sometimes you won't be even able to open the file due to its huge size. Now, what if you want to get some rows of data from that xml file. XMLFile Splitter comes for the rescue. 

With the power of Python, XMLFile Splitter can get the required rows and create a new xml file for you without even opening that huge xml file. To get 10-20  rows of data, it takes less than 30 seconds.
